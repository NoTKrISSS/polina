                    Ukraine has a very old national idea, actually. The idea of Ukraine goes back into the 17th century
                    at least. And one can talk about the history of Ukraine which is much older than that. The Ukrainian
                    national movement comes from the 19th century and really it was a quite typical European national
                    movement - anti-imperial, focused on the people as the subjects of of history.
